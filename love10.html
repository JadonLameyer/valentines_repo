        <p class="valentine-text">i loved this day so much! i really wished we spent more days like we did here, relaxing and just spending time outside with each other. we got there a bit late (not complaining because i really enjoyed what we were doing), but thankfully we got there in time to enjoy the sunset. <br>
            those moments are always so special to me because it's always just you and i against the world, just us two, and i wouldn't have it any other way. <br>
            this period wasn't the easiest for you, and i'll never be able to make up for the hurt i caused you, but being able to sit on that rock with you and just have a moment with you will always hold such a special place in my heartðŸ’–<br>
            i love us, and i love being your boyfriend, and i promise to spend each and every day showing you how special you are to me. <br>
            i'm so excited about us, about our future, about all the memories we're going to make together, all the adventures we're going to go on!<br>
            you mean the absolute world to me and i'm counting the seconds until i see you again <3 (i may or may not be able to accurately know that number)</p>
