            every moment with you is something I'll cherish forever.
            this day in particular was all over the place, we walked for hours,
            but walking my favourite route with my favourite person was so special to me.
            once we eventually found our spot to eat, i got a little glimpse into your heart and it really made me so incredibly grateful to have someone care for me and love me the way you do.
            not many people have the privilege of experiencing what i do and you can't even imagine how lucky i am.
            you don't share a lot but when you do it really means the world.
            thank you for being my love ❤️
        </p>
