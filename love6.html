    <p>the most perfect day!!! (well it would've been even more perfect without the can of savana)<br>
    you looked so beautiful! you mentioned how you wished you never showed me the dress beforehand, but when i tell you i've never seen someone so beautiful, in a dress so elegant - completely breathtaking <br>
    i won't lie in saying i didn't have a lot of alcohol this day but even though i can't remember how i ended up in my bed or how i put my pants on- i remember running to you the moment the music started, finding a space for just us two, holding your waist and staring straight into your eyes. i whispered in your eyes and slowly swayed to each side. with every twirl i thought about how lucky i am to be here, in that moment, with YOU! <br>
    there was no other person in the entire world but you. those 4 minutes were some of the best in my life<br>
    you're the most beautiful dance partner <3 (and we'll get more photos in formalwear don't worry) <br>
