            no matter what, i'll never miss an oppurtunity to celebrate you <br>
            nomthandazo martha rametsi, from the moment i sat across from you- i knew you were special and oh my were my expectations exceeded <br>
            your birthdays are always special to me because it gives me a chance to show how much you mean to me <br>
            i might not have shown it but i was so stressed this day because i just wanted you to have the best time- you deserve the world and i want to be the one bringing you every stone <br>
            you've shown me such a beautiful love and i'll never take that lightly, you really are the love of my life <br>
            even though the cullinary experience didn't end the way we needed it to (i was still a little hungery as well lol), i can't wait to spend so many more birthdays making you feel special!<br>
            i love celebrating you my brilliant nomthandazo martha rametsi <3 <br>
