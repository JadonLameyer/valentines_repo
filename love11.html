                these two videos dont come from the same day, but both are really special in the same way...<br>
                i'v spoken to you about how i always felt like i don't deserve a good, pure, true love, and both of these moments show me that a beautiful love is what i found in us!<br>
                i only saw you for a couple of hours, probably even less, but just being able to see you and spend time with you one last time was the only thing on my mind. you'd think that we'd want to do something crazy, but one thing i've noticed with us is that no matter when i leave it doesn't hit until the very,very end because we both know we will see each other (not when but we know we will). i hate seeing you cry no matter the situation, but when i took this video and watched it back later, it really made me realise how blsessed i am to have a love like this, and to have someone like you in my life.<br>
                the second video is literally the best thing ever, and you can see it on my face. this was supposed to be your day (and you lowkey spoiled it by giving me this, but i forgive you) but this was literally the best gift i've ever gotten and it meant so much to me. i didn't want to show it but you genuinely made me want to ball out crying because that was the sweetest thing ever, but you know me being a MANLY MAN and whatnot lol<br>
                thank you for always making me feel so special, you really mean the world to me!<br>
                i love you a billion + 1! ❤️ <br>
