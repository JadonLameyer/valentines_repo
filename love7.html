                you're probably wondering what photos are these? you looking cute in the kitchen, my plate shoiwng the ingredients to my sexy shwarma- a normal date night right?<br>
                this was day 1 of our official relationship! these were taken on the 7th of June 2024, the day the most beautiful relationship started :)<br>
                you and i have been through a lot, and the relationship hasn't been straightforward, but you have no idea how much this means to me- it means the absolute world<br>
                i love you so much, and it breaks my heart knowing that my selfish decisions hurt you so much, but i want you to know and to always remember that each and every day i wake up with being the best boyfriend i can be top of my agenda. you mean so much to me, you're literally my bestie, and making sure that i can be the best person for you and for us is so important to me. you make me want to be better, make me want to be the best i can be. <br>
                this day was the official start of something so special in my life and each and every day i wake up so lucky to say this!❤️ <br>
                thank you for being the best girlfreind i could ever ask for :) <br>
                i love you!
