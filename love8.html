            <p>
                this picture made me so happy!<br>
                i think about my life right now in london, earning money, being independant, doing new things, meeting cool people, exploring...<br>
                but the one thing that always feels like the piece missing from the puzzle is having you wiht me<br>
                spending time with you, going out and about literally doing anything feels like such a beautiful aspect of my life because it's always so effortless and fun, you make any normal moment feel like a beautiful memory about to be made <br>
                we spoke about this the other night and i'm sorry for making you feel like you aren't doing enough, i don't ever want to do or say anything that makes you feel that way. you are my special person and you make me feel like the luckiest boyfriend in the whole world.<br>
                i miss you so much and can't wait to explore london and the rest of the world with you! <br>
                i cant' wait to see you again! ❤️ <br>
